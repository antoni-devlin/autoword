From a range of stimulating pathways, you choose one that best suits your interests. Modules are shared across pathways, and are rooted in academic and practice-based research.
   
  
  
	The MA Music delivers core skills for academic research into music. Providing a uniquely creative approach to graduate studies, the degree accommodates diverse interests and approaches.
The programme and pathways available are:

MA Music (General)
Musicology (Pathway A)
Contemporary Music Studies (Pathway B)
Ethnomusicology (Pathway C)
Popular Music Research (Pathway D)

The MA Music equips graduates to take up careers in music such as journalism, teaching, broadcasting, librarianship, historically informed performance, contemporary composition, and arts administration. The programme’s modules explore music as an evolving subject, covering repertories from Western art music through to electronic, popular, audio-visual, non-Western, and contemporary repertories.

You develop systematic, critical and creative approaches, exploring musical practice, discourses, and contexts.
You develop an independent and original approach to current questions and debates.
You explore interrelationships between music and other subjects, between theory and practice, and between performance and structural interpretation.

The MA Music is an academic rather than a practice-based degree. If you're keen to study composition or performance, please explore our MMus programme and its pathways.

Music Studies)","The MA Music (Contemporary Music Studies) examines aspects of methodology, repertoire studies and cultural theory within a wide-ranging programme of investigation into the role of contemporary music in the society for which it is created.  
  
  
	You'll explore the key methodologies appropriate for scholarly study of the music of the present and recent past, such as oral history and contrasting approaches to musical ‘close reading’.
Musical repertoires, and notions of repertoire, are examined, and you are encouraged to ask such questions as whether the boundaries often considered to exist between, for example, ‘contemporary concert music’ and ‘popular music’ are still meaningful for practitioners, listeners and scholars today.
Various approaches to cultural theory are viewed in the light of what they might bring to the study of contemporary music of different kinds.
The understandings developed in your coursework culminate in the methods and approaches demonstrated in your dissertation.
This gives you the opportunity to address particular challenges of studying and writing about the music of our time arising from your own musical and theoretical enthusiasms.
The programme appeals to a wide range of students concerned to develop their understanding of today's music and keen to harness this to relevant intellectual skills.
While designed as an open-ended programme of study that can subsequently be applied in many ways within, and outside, the musical profession, it will be of special value to those preparing for further postgraduate research, and those considering careers in teaching, journalism, arts administration or the culture industries.

musical texts, artefacts and ecologies
audiences, reception and questions of interpretation
creativity, industries and production
repertoires broad in historical range and geographical scope

The course addresses contemporary issues of significance to academics, musicians, industries and organisations involved with popular music.
You'll develop research skills, critical thinking and rigorous methodological expertise with a range of applications both within the academy (at doctoral level) and outside (in music-related industries, marketing, arts management, museums and archives, the sciences).
Although a knowledge of and passion for popular music is vital, it is not essential that your first degree is in music or popular music.
We welcome applicants from a wide range of disciplines: the course is designed to be of benefit not only to those wishing to continue their research at doctoral level, but also those wishing to reflect on their experiences as musicians, listeners, or media and arts industry professionals.

	Although professional management practice is a major element of the programme, the 'creative arts event' is the starting point for all teaching.
A music pathway has been added to the MA Arts Administration and Cultural Policy, which is run by the Institute for Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurship at Goldsmiths.
Instead of specialist theatre modules you take one 30 credit module from the MA Music or MMus programmes, and your dissertation/placement/business-plan will be directed towards musical organisations.
The MA introduces the key issues that concern the management of culture and in particular those within the performing arts.
Through both analysis of contemporary and recent practice, and practical work in a range of areas, you will develop a critical approach to the discipline.
The pathway provides an overview of the following areas:

arts funding structures in the UK (with reference to EU countries and the USA)
marketing for the arts
audience development
sponsorship
education programmes within the arts
programming
culture and tourism
cultural policy (including the role of the arts in national and cultural identity) and principles and structures of management

The aim of taught modules, projects and placements is to introduce you to new models of practice. These will be investigated and evaluated as a way of developing an understanding of management principles. Through this process, you will also be equipped with the necessary practical skills to enhance your potential as arts administrators.
